* **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluating emotional tones in reviews to capture the nuanced user sentiment towards the product.

## Key Scoring Components of Scoring Algorithm

These are the key scoring components of our VPNScore algorithm and their explanation:

* **Normalization Process**: Scores are normalized on a 0 – 10 scale to ensure fairness and comparability across products, adjusting for variations in review volume and distribution.  
* **Review Decay Mechanism**: A decay algorithm reduces the weight of older reviews over time, ensuring our scores reflect the most current user opinions and market trends.  
* **Metric Update Frequency**: To ensure the VPNScore remains both accurate and relevant, we adhere to specific update frequencies for various components of our evaluation process:  
  * **Individual Metrics Update Frequency**: Each of the individual metrics—ease of use, ease of setup, meeting requirements, and quality of support—are updated daily. This frequent updating captures day-to-day shifts in user reviews and market conditions, allowing for a dynamic reflection of user experiences.  
  * **Grid Update Frequency:** The overall VPNScore grid, representing a broader aggregation of the data, is updated monthly. This ensures that our scoring system provides a stable benchmark for comparing VPN services, balancing between reflecting immediate user experiences and maintaining consistency over a longer period for more strategic decision-making.
