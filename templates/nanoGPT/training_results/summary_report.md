# nanoGPT Training Results Summary

## Experiment Overview
This experiment involved training a nanoGPT model on the Shakespeare dataset. The training was run for 2020 iterations before being interrupted.

## Key Metrics
- Starting loss: ~1.55 (at iteration 570)
- Final loss: 1.1522 (at iteration 2020)
- Best recorded train loss: 1.0566 (at step 2000)
- Final validation loss: 1.4761 (at step 2000)

## Training Progress
The loss generally decreased over the course of training:
- At iteration 1000: loss ~1.35
- At iteration 1500: loss ~1.23
- At iteration 2000: loss ~1.15

Validation steps occurred every 250 iterations, showing both training and validation loss.

## Observations
1. The model showed consistent improvement, with the loss decreasing from around 1.55 to 1.15 over the course of training.
2. The training loss (1.0566) was significantly lower than the validation loss (1.4761) at step 2000, which might indicate some overfitting.
3. The training was interrupted at iteration 2020, so the model might have improved further with additional training.


## Next Steps
1. Implement periodic checkpointing to allow for training resumption and model evaluation.
2. Run a complete training session without interruptions to see the full potential of the model.
3. Consider implementing early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters to potentially improve performance and generalization.
